# BhopM

Bunnyhop plugin derived from ReFlexPoison's [Simple Bunny Hop](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=209853), with special behavior.

When players crouch while bhopping, on impact they will not take fall damage and their vertical velocity will be inverted rather than being set to a constant value (in effect, they preserve the height they hopped from).

### CVars
`bhopm_version` - Plugin version  
`sm_bhop_enable <0|1> (def. 1)` - Enable/disable bhop globally

### Commands
`sm_bhop` - Toggle bhop for yourself
